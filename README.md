# Toney

**Toney** is a fast, lightweight, terminal-based note-taking app for the modern developer. Built with [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), Toney brings a sleek TUI interface with markdown rendering, file navigation, and native Neovim editing – all in your terminal.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Blazingly Fast** – Minimal memory usage and snappy performance.
- 📝 **Markdown Renderer** – Styled previews via [`glamour`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour).
- 🧠 **Neovim Integration** – Edit your notes using your favorite editor (`nvim`).
- 📂 **File Management** – Easily navigate, open, and manage markdown files.
- 🧩 **Component Architecture** – Modular codebase using Bubbletea’s `Model` system.

## 🚀 Installation

You can install **Toney** directly using `go install`:

```
go install github.com/SourcewareLab/Toney@latest
```

This will download, build, and install the `Toney` binary into your `$GOBIN` (typically `$HOME/go/bin`).

Run this command to ensure Toney is setup perfectly.

```
  Toney init
```

### 🧪 Requirements

- Go 1.16 or later
- Git (to fetch the module)

Make sure your `GOBIN` is in your system's `PATH`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOBIN)
```

### ✅ Verify Installation

Once installed, you can run:

```
Toney
```

## 🔑 Keybinds

| Key Combination | Action                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **F** / **Shift + F** | Focus on File Tree         |
| **V** / **Shift + V** | Focus on File Viewer       |

### 📁 File Tree Focus Shortcuts

Once the File Tree is focused (`F` or `Shift + F`):

| Key      | Action         |
|----------|----------------|
| **c**    | Create a file/folder |
| **d**    | Delete selected     |
| **r**    | Rename selected     |
| **m**    | Move selected       |
| **Enter**| Edit selected file  |

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Toney follows Go and Bubbletea conventions.

### 🧾 Guidelines

- Follow idiomatic Go formatting (`go fmt`, `go vet`, `golint`).
- Use `Init`, `Update`, and `View` separation for all models.
- Keep component responsibilities well-isolated.
- All exported functions/types should be documented with Go-style comments.
- Prefer `tea.Msg` messages over direct cross-component function calls.

### ✅ How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Write your code and make sure it builds:
   ```bash
   go build ./...
   ```

3. Format your code:
   ```bash
   go fmt ./...
   ```

4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add my awesome feature"
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

5. Submit a Pull Request 🎉

Please open an issue or discussion for large changes before starting them.
